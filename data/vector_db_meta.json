NOTICE: Do not clean aluminum wheels with steel wool, abrasive-type cleaners or strong detergents. Damage to the wheel finish may occur. Use Wheel and Tire Cleaner ZC-37-A or -B or equivalent. Factory-installed tires and wheels are designed to operate satisfactorily with loads up to and including fullrated load capacity when inflated to recommended inflation pressures. Correct tire pressure and driving techniques have an important influence on tire life. Heavy cornering, excessively rapid acceleration and unnecessary sharp braking increase tire wear. To equalize tire wear, the tires should be rotated at recommended intervals.

Failure to follow these instructions may result in serious personal injury. The Tire Pressure Monitor (TPM) module monitors the tire pressure of all 4 road tires. The wheel-mounted tire pressure sensors transmit signals via radio frequency to the TPM module. The TPM module is a radio receiver that collects the tire pressure data from the tire pressure sensors. The TPMS sensor radio transmissions are sent once approximately every 60 seconds when the vehicle speed exceeds 32 km/h (20 mph). The data is then sent to the Body Control Module (BCM) where a predetermined pass/fail criteria is applied. The BCM compares each TPMS sensor transmission against a low-pressure limit. If it has been determined that the tire pressure has fallen below this limit, the BCM communicates this on the vehicle communication bus to the Instrument Panel Cluster (IPC). The IPC then illuminates the TPMS warning indicator and displays the appropriate message(s) in the message center. Ambient Temperature Change and Tire Pressure Tire pressures fluctuate with temperature changes. For this reason, tire pressure must be set to specification SECTION 204-04: Wheels and Tires 2014 F-150 Workshop Manual DIAGNOSIS AND TESTING Procedure revision date: 10/25/2013 Special Tool(s) Activation Tool, Tire Pressure Monitor 204-363 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge 204-354 Vehicle Communication Module (VCM) and Integrated Diagnostic System (IDS) software with appropriate hardware, or equivalent scan tool Page 1 sur 19 2014 F-150 Workshop Manual 2014-03-01 file:///C:/TSO/tsocache/VDTOM2_10764/SE2~us~en~file=SE244004.HTM~gen~ref.HT... repair4less"

If the vehicle is allowed to warm up to shop temperatures, and the outside temperature is less than shop temperature, the tire inflation pressure must be adjusted accordingly. If the tires are inflated to specification at shop temperatures, and the vehicle is moved outdoors when the outdoor ambient temperature is significantly lower, the tire pressure may drop enough to be detected by the TPMS and activate the TPMS warning indicator. As the ambient temperature decreases by 6\u00b0C (10\u00b0F), tire pressure decreases 7 kPa (1 psi). Adjust the tire pressure by 7 kPa (1 psi) for each 6\u00b0C (10\u00b0F) ambient temperature drop as necessary to keep the tire at the specified Vehicle Certification (VC) label pressure.

        "text": "If a sensor in a certain location has caused several events, yet the sensor trains and seems to operate normally, moving that particular wheel to a different location on the vehicle is a good way to isolate the issue to a certain sensor/wheel location. Rotate the wheels and road test the vehicle. This can be done in an attempt to replicate the issue. This determines if the issue followed the sensor or remained in the original sensor location. Training Sensors in a Different Order This is a technique to get past a left front sensor that may not be responding to determine if the remaining sensors train to the module. This can help save time determining if other sensors are having issues or if the module is experiencing training difficulties with a certain location. Training Known Good Sensors From Another Vehicle Training known good sensors from another vehicle cannot differentiate between a faulted module and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), as some noise source could be preventing the TPM module from receiving the tire pressure status from the original sensors as well as the known good sensors. This technique can be used to differentiate between a sensor and module issue. If the TPM module cannot train any of the sensors on the same vehicle, and likewise cannot train known good sensors from another vehicle, then the issue is with the TPM module or RFI and not with the original sensors. The original sensors should not be replaced.

These car alarms can sometimes be difficult to locate, as they are usually hidden somewhere out of the way for reduced accessibility. z Many different in-vehicle cell phone chargers have been found to cause considerable RFI . The vehicles with the power point closest to the TPM module are the most affected. It must be noted that most cell phone chargers do not produce high levels of RFI all the time. This depends on the state of charge of the cell phone battery. The phone must be almost completely discharged in some cases. z Power supplies and DC/AC inverters typically create a lot of RFI . Most consumer grade equipment has very little filtering or shielding. OEM Modules In some cases, the RFI may actually be caused by a module or ground on the vehicle. Depending on the severity of the issue, a dirty ground, improperly built ground shield or module can disable the system. Modules that have microcontrollers using clock circuits to create the timing pulses for the microprocessor may radiate RFI . Using Customer's Electronics to Pinpoint the Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) Source This can be a way to determine the cause of an issue well before the sensors and module are replaced with little or no affect on the system performance.

Abnormal/incorrect tire wear can be caused by numerous factors, some of which include driving style (aggressive, passive), climate (hot, cold), road conditions, vehicle loading and maintenance (correct tire pressure, rotation intervals and balance). It is important to determine the root cause of wear on a vehicle before carrying out repair. Tires exhibiting abnormal/incorrect tire wear may still be serviceable provided that the minimum tread depth is greater than 2/32 inch and the tire is not causing a vehicle performance (noise/vibration) concern. Some abnormal/incorrect wear patterns look the same all the way around the tread of the tire, other wear patterns are not consistent and can occur in various spots on the tread area. The underlying causes of the 6 wear categories are different. Refer to the following descriptions to identify the type of wear and the appropriate repair action to be carried out. Inner Edge/Shoulder Wear Inner edge (or shoulder) wear occurs on the inside edge of the tire and is usually caused by excessive toe out and/or excessive negative camber. If the tread depth of the outer shoulder is at least 50% greater than the tread depth of the inner shoulder, the tire is experiencing inner edge/shoulder wear.

On a wheel and tire assembly, this means measuring the center tire tread rib. The center rib is indicative of the condition of the tire as a whole. Total runout is the difference between the maximum-tominimum gauge reading. The high spot is the location of maximum runout. Loaded Runout Measurement (Hunter Road Force\u00ae 9700 Series Wheel Balancer) NOTE: Diagnosis of tire/wheel vibration should not be performed on tires with less than 320 km (200 mi). Some initial tire/wheel vibration issues (such as flat spotting) correct themselves after the tires have been in service for 320 km (200 mi). This procedure is intended to assist with the diagnosis of wheel and tire assembly runout and/or force variation issues. The Hunter Road Force\u00ae 9700 Series Wheel Balancer measures the wheel and tire assembly's loaded runout and the tire's radial spring rate. The balancer then converts the runout into pounds of force (termed as Road Force\u00ae). Measuring loaded runout (Road Force\u00ae) is more effective than measuring unloaded runout using a dial indicator. 1. Using a tire crayon, record the vehicle position on the inner sidewall of all 4 tires. 2. Remove the wheel and tire assemblies. For additional information, refer to Wheel and Tire in this section. 3.

The driveline transfers the engine torque through the driveshaft to the axle. The rear driveshaft is connected to the output shaft of the transmission or transfer case and to the rear axle. The front driveshaft is connected to the transfer case and to the front axle. Slip yokes are used to allow for any changes to the length of the driveshaft. Changes in length are self-adjusted up in the driveshaft slip mechanism. The engine torque enters the axle through the drive pinion, which rotates the ring gear. The ring gear is mounted to the differential case, which contains the gears that transmit power to the rear axle shafts or front halfshafts. These shafts and halfshafts rotate the drive wheels. The Electronic Locking Differential (ELD) rear axle assembly, except for the differential case and its internal components, is identical to the conventional rear axle. The ELD employs an electronically operated magnetic coil to engage the unit. The Traction-Lok rear axle assembly, except for the differential case and its internal components, is identical to the conventional rear axle. The Traction-Lok employs 2 multi-disc differential clutch packs to control differential action. The mounting distance of the differential side gear is controlled by plates on each side, friction and steel.

The drive pinion seal can be torn, cut or gouged if it is not installed correctly. The spring that holds the drive pinion seal against the pinion flange may be knocked out and allow fluid to pass the lip. Metal chips trapped at the sealing lip can cause oil leaks. These can cause a wear groove on the drive pinion flange and result in pinion seal wear. When a seal leak occurs, install a new drive pinion seal and check the vent to make sure it is clean and free of foreign material. A new drive pinion flange must be installed if any of these conditions exist. Drive Pinion Nut NOTICE: Install the drive pinion nut to the correct torque specifications or damage to the differential components may occur. On some high-mileage vehicles, oil may leak through the threads of the drive pinion nut. This condition can be corrected by installing a new nut and applying threadlock and sealer on the threads and nut face.

Driveline vibration is directly related to the speed of the vehicle and is noticed at various speeds. Driveline vibration can be perceived as a tremor in the floorpan or heard as a rumble, hum or boom. NOTE: Refer to Specifications in this section for all runout specifications. 1. NOTE: Do not make any adjustments before carrying out a road test. Do not change the tire pressure or the vehicle load. Carry out a visual inspection of the vehicle. Operate the vehicle and verify the condition by reproducing it during the road test. z The concern should be directly related to vehicle road speed, not affected by acceleration or deceleration or could not be reduced by coasting in NEUTRAL. 2. With the vehicle in NEUTRAL, position it on a hoist. For additional information, refer to Section 10002 . z The driveshaft should be kept at an angle equal to or close to the curb-weighted position. Use a twin-post hoist or a frame hoist with jackstands. 3. Inspect the driveshaft for damage, undercoating or incorrectly seated U-joints. Rotate the driveshaft slowly by hand and feel for binding or end play in the U-joint trunnions. Remove the driveshaft. For additional information, refer to Section 205-01 . Inspect the slip yoke splines for any galling, dirt, rust or incorrect lubrication. Clean the driveshaft or install new U-joints as necessary. Install a new driveshaft if damaged.

        "text": "Rear Drive Axle and Differential The rear axle assembly consists of the following: z Integral-type housing hypoid gear design (center of the pinion set below the centerline of the ring gear) z Hypoid differential ring gear and pinion consists of an 8.8-inch ring gear and an overhung drive pinion that is supported by 2 opposed tapered roller bearings z Axle housing assembly that consists of a cast center section with 2 steel tube assemblies and a stamped differential housing cover z Differential pinion shaft is retained by a threaded differential pinion shaft lock bolt attached to the differential case z Differential case is mounted in the rear axle housing between 2 opposing differential bearings that are retained in the rear axle housing by 2 removable bearing caps The rear drive axle receives rotational torque from the driveshaft. The direction of the rotation determines movement of the vehicle. The rotation enters the rear drive axle through the drive pinion flange, turning the drive pinion and rotating the ring gear. The ring gear is bolted to the differential case. The differential case houses the pinion shaft upon which the differential pinion gears ride. The pinion gears are in mesh with the differential side gears to which the axle shafts are splined. It is the unique arrangement of the differential that allows the axle shafts to be driven at different speed when needed, such as when driving around corners. A Traction-Lok differential is also available that introduces a series of clutch plates and discs behind the differential side gears to deliver as much torque as possible to each axle shaft when the traction at the rear wheels is not equal. The Traction-Lok differential requires a friction modifier that must be installed with the axle lubricant for the plates and discs to be functional."

It is the unique arrangement of the differential that allows the axle shafts to be driven at different speed when needed, such as when driving around corners. A Traction-Lok differential is available that introduces a series of clutch plates and discs behind the differential side gears to deliver as much torque as possible to each axle shaft when the traction at the rear wheels is not equal. The Traction-Lok differential requires a friction modifier that must be installed with the axle lubricant for the plates and discs to be functional. An Electronic Locking Differential (ELD) is also available which electronically locks the differential side gears to the differential case which will allow maximum torque to both rear wheels. The operator controls the differential with a dash mounted switch. The ELD system consists of the following components: z ELD coil, located at the rear differential z Rear differential z Mode Select Switch (MSS) (unique for ELD equipped vehicles), located on instrument panel The ELD system, which is optional on Electronic Shift-On-The-Fly (ESOF) equipped vehicles, allows the operator to lock the rear differential side gears when in 4H or 4L mode. ELD operation is requested by pulling out on the MSS when in 4H or 4L mode. The operator can switch between 4H mode without ELD or 4H mode with ELD at speeds up to 30 km/h (19 mph). In 4H, the ELD will disengage at speeds above 40 km/h (25 mph) and will automatically reengage at speeds below 30 km/h (19 mph).

Inside the differential case are the pinion gears which rotate on the stationary pinion shaft and the side gears which are splined to the axle shafts. The differential assembly is a gear arrangement that allows the drive wheels to be driven at different speeds and divides the input torque of the pinion gear between the axle halfshafts. The front axle transmits torque only and carries no vehicle load. CV joints located at each end of the halfshafts allow the axle to remain stationary in relationship to front wheels, yet articulate at the knuckle. These CV joints permit the wheels to be driven and turned at the same time. Lack of lubrication is among the most common causes of CV joint concerns. It is essential that all CV boots and clamps be inspected for damage or signs of leakage. Refer to Section 205-04 . The Torsen\u00ae front differential case houses the parallel axis planetary helical side gears to which the axle halfshafts are splined. It is the unique arrangement of the differential that allows the continuous, uninterrupted torque output and allows the axle halfshafts to be driven at different speed when needed, such as when driving around corners. There are no clutch plates or discs in this axle design. The Torsen\u00ae differential requires 4.0 oz of friction modifier to be added with the axle lubricant. The axle shafts are retained in this differential with the circlips.

The CV joints allow the halfshafts to rotate smoothly through the required changes in angles between the stationary axle and the varying angles of the front wheels including jounce and rebound plus changes while turning. The CV joints are either trilobed style or the caged ball type depending on inboard or outboard. New halfshaft components are available as kits containing grease, boots and clamps. Halfshaft Handling Handle all halfshaft components carefully during removal and installation and during various component disassembly and assembly procedures. z Never pick up or hold the halfshaft only by the inboard or outboard CV joint. z Do not overangle the CV joints. z Damage will occur to an assembled inboard CV joint if it is overplunged outward from the joint housing. z Never use a hammer to remove or install the halfshafts from the hub. z Never use the halfshaft assembly as a lever to position other components. Always support the free end of the halfshaft. z Do not allow the boots to contact sharp edges or hot exhaust components. z Handle the halfshaft only by the interconnecting shaft to avoid pull-apart and potential damage to the CV joints. z Excessive pulling force on the interconnecting shaft between joints of the halfshaft will result in internal joint"

        "text": "Principles of Operation Brake System Applying the brake pedal uses lever action to push a rod into the brake booster, which through the use of vacuum, boosts the force of the rod and then transmits this force to the primary piston in the master cylinder. This produces hydraulic pressure in the master cylinder. This pressure builds in the master cylinder and brake tubes as the brake pedal is applied further. The pressure between the primary and secondary piston forces the secondary piston to compress, building pressure in its circuit. The hydraulic pressure is transmitted by brake fluid through the brake tubes to the ABS Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU), which then distributes that pressure to the individual brake calipers. The brake calipers use hydraulic pressure to apply the pads. The application of the brake pads will cause the rotation of the wheels to slow or stop, depending on how much brake pressure is applied. The parking brakes carry out the same function except that they are mechanically actuated by a cable that connects only to the rear brakes. Brake Master Cylinder Compensator Ports The purpose of the compensator ports in the brake master cylinder is to supply additional brake fluid from the master cylinder reservoir when needed by the brake system due to brake lining wear and allow brake fluid to return to the master cylinder reservoir when the brakes are released. The returning brake fluid creates a slight turbulence in the master cylinder reservoir. This is a normal condition and indicates that the compensator ports are not clogged. Clogged compensator ports may cause the brakes to hang up or not fully release. Red Brake Warning Indicator The red brake warning indicator alerts the driver to certain conditions that exist in the brake system. The Instrument Cluster (IC) performs a bulb"

        "text": "Rear Disc Brake The rear disc brake system consists of the following components: z Brake caliper z Brake caliper support bracket z Brake disc z Brake pads z Inner brake flexible hose z Outer brake flexible hose When mechanical force is applied by the driver to the brake pedal, the force is converted into hydraulic pressure by the master cylinder. The hydraulic force is directed to the disc brake calipers and transferred to the brake pads. The brake pads are then forced against the brake friction surfaces by the brake caliper pistons. The friction of the brake pads on the brake disc causes the slowing or stopping of wheel rotation and the vehicle.

        "text": "Parking Brake Principles of Operation Parking Brake System The parking brake system is an independent, cable-actuated system controlled by an foot-operated parking brake control that is self adjusting. The parking brake control applies tension to the front parking brake cable and conduit. The front parking brake cable is coupled to the LH rear parking brake cable and conduit which is coupled to the RH rear parking brake cable. The parking brake cable and conduits actuate the parking brake levers, engaging the parking brake shoes with the parking brake drum-in-hat assembly. The system is returned to the released position by pulling the parking brake control release handle. Springs in the parking brake system apply the necessary force to return the system to the unapplied position. The parking brake warning indicator is located in the instrument cluster. It illuminates to signal the driver that the parking brake is applied or to signal a low brake fluid condition. The warning indicator system is diagnosed in Section 41301 . Inspection and Verification NOTE: Prior to carrying out any diagnosis, make sure the red brake warning indicator is functional. Refer to Section 413-01 . The first indication that something may be wrong in the brake system is a change in the feeling through the parking brake control. The parking brake not holding on an incline or dragging after being released are also indicators of system concerns. Check the operation of the parking brake system with the vehicle on a hoist and the parking brake control fully released. Check for any damaged cables and install new components as necessary. Check the rear brake adjustment or carry out the brake system diagnosis. 1. Verify the customer concern. 2. Visually inspect for obvious signs of mechanical damage.

Normal Operation When the desired memory position is selected using the memory SET switch or the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) transmitter, the Driver Seat Module (DSM) communicates the desired pedals position in a message on the Medium Speed Controller Area Network (MS-CAN) bus to the Body Control Module (BCM). The BCM acts as a gateway module, relaying the message to the Steering Column Control Module (SCCM) over the High Speed Controller Area Network (HS-CAN) bus.

        "text": "Principles of Operation Hydraulic Brakes The brake pedal is connected to the power brake booster, which is connected to the brake master cylinder. When the brake pedal is pressed, brake fluid is forced through the double-walled steel tubes and flexible hoses to the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU). The brake fluid is then distributed to the front and rear brake calipers. The fluid enters the caliper, forcing the caliper pistons and brake pads outward against the brake disc friction surface, slowing or stopping rotation of the brake disc. When the brake pedal is released, brake fluid pressure is relieved, returning the front and rear brake caliper pistons and brake pads to the unapplied position. To diagnose hydraulic brake concerns, refer to Section 206-00 . For information on the HCU , refer to Section 206-09 . Adjustable Pedals Without Memory Feature The adjustable pedals without memory are controlled by the brake pedal control switch and the Steering Column Control Module (SCCM). The adjustable pedals motor is attached to the accelerator pedal bracket and controls the accelerator pedals directly. It operates forward and rearward, depending on which direction the switch is pressed. The adjustable brake pedals is connected to the motor by a cable that rotates inside a sleeve. This allows both the brake and accelerator pedals to move together as an assembly. When the brake pedal control switch is pressed, voltage is applied from the SCCM to the adjustable pedals motor. The end of the motor that is attached to the accelerator pedal bracket rotates the pinion of a worm gear set and causes the accelerator pedal to move.

The pedals can be adjusted with the ignition switch in the OFF, ACC or RUN position, regardless of gear selector position. The SCCM monitors the adjustable pedals motor and circuits for faults. If a fault is detected, the SCCM is capable of setting DTCs. Adjustable Pedals With Memory Feature The adjustable pedals with memory are controlled by the SCCM , Body Control Module (BCM) and Driver Seat Module (DSM). The pedals can be adjusted in 3 different ways: z Using the brake pedal control switch. z Using the memory SET switch. z Using the Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) transmitter. The SCCM monitors the position of the pedals using a Hall-effect sensor that is integral to the adjustable pedals motor. When a memory position is recalled through either the memory SET switch or the RKE transmitter, the SCCM monitors the Hall-effect sensor and stops sending voltage to the motor once the SECTION 206-06: Hydraulic Brake Actuation 2014 F-150 Workshop Manual DIAGNOSIS AND TESTING Procedure revision date: 10/25/2013 Page 1 sur 2 2014 F-150 Workshop Manual 2014-03-01 file:///C:/TSO/tsocache/VDTOM2_10764/SE2~us~en~file=SE266003.HTM~gen~ref.HT... repair4less"

If the SCCM receives a pedals position input during a memory position recall function, the module stops the memory recall and responds to the new pedals position input. When the RKE transmitter is activated, a message is sent over the Medium Speed Controller Area Network (MS-CAN) to the DSM . When the memory SET switch is pressed, the DSM senses continuity to ground on the switch circuit. When the DSM receives either the MS-CAN message or the ground input through the switch circuit, it sends a message over the MS-CAN to the BCM . The BCM acts as a gateway module, relaying the MS-CAN message that was received from the DSM to the SCCM over the High Speed Controller Area Network (HS-CAN). The SCCM then sends voltage over the appropriate circuit to the adjustable pedals motor to adjust the pedals. The SCCM continuously monitors the adjustable pedals motor and circuits for faults. If a fault is detected, the SCCM is capable of setting DTCs. The DSM also controls the driver seat and the exterior mirrors.

        "text": "Brake Booster The power brake actuation system consists of the following components: z Brake booster z Brake booster check valve z Brake booster vacuum sensor z Brake booster vacuum supply hose z Brake booster vacuum pump (3.5L GTDI engine only) The brake booster uses vacuum from the intake manifold (3.7L and 5.0L) or an engine mounted vacuum pump (3.5L GTDI ) to create a partial vacuum inside the vacuum booster on both sides of the diaphragm. When the brake pedal is pressed, the booster rod opens a valve, allowing air to enter the booster on one side of the diaphragm while sealing off the opposite side. This increases pressure on that side of the diaphragm so that it helps push the rod, which in turn pushes the piston in the master cylinder. As the brake pedal is released, the valve seals off the outside air supply while opening the vacuum valve. This restores vacuum to both sides of the diaphragm, allowing everything to return to its original position. The ABS module uses the signals produced by the vacuum sensor to verify the vacuum is maintained in the brake booster. Brake Booster Vacuum Pump Vehicles equipped with a 3.5L GTDI engine are also equipped with an engine mounted/cam-driven brake booster vacuum pump. The brake vacuum pump is located on the backside of the RH cylinder head. Refer to Brake Vacuum Pump . z For vacuum sensor and vacuum pump diagnosis, refer to Section 206-09 .

Trailer Sway Control Trailer sway control is a unique function in the AdvanceTrac\u00ae with RSC\u00ae system that recognizes and aids in reducing trailer sway. The trailer sway control function continually monitors the steering wheel rotation and yaw rate sensors to identify specific, increasing yaw oscillations that occur during a trailer sway event. If the trailer sway event exceeds programmed parameters, the ABS module and the HCU modulate brake fluid pressure to specific brake caliper(s) and the PCM modulates engine torque until the trailer sway is reduced below the programmed parameters.

When the vehicle is traveling at speeds above 21 km/h (13 mph) and the brake pedal is not being pressed, the HCU pump motor is commanded on for approximately 0.5 second to check pump motor operation. Also, during all phases of operation while the vehicle is in motion, the ABS module checks for correct operation of the wheel speed sensors by comparing wheel speed input to other sensor input. Depending on the nature of the malfunction detected, the ABS module deactivates the anti-lock control system and sends a message over the HS-CAN to the IPC . When the IPC receives this message, it illuminates the yellow ABS warning indicator and the stability/traction control indicator (sliding car icon). Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) On initial application of the brake pedal, full pressure is applied to the rear brakes. The ABS module then uses wheel speed input to calculate an estimated rate of deceleration. Once vehicle deceleration exceeds a predetermined threshold, the ABS module commands the HCU to close the appropriate isolation valves to hold the rear brake pressure constant while allowing the front brake pressure to build. This creates a balanced braking condition between the front and rear wheels and minimizes the chance of rear wheel lockup during hard braking. As the vehicle decelerates, the valves are opened to increase the rear brake pressure in proportion to the front brake pressure. If ABS is disabled due to DTCs being present in the ABS module, EBD continues to function unless the DTCs are for wheel speed sensors or the HCU .

When EBD is disabled, the red brake warning light, the ABS warning indicator and the stability/traction control indicator (sliding car icon) illuminate. Supplemental Braking Assist The ABS module uses the HCU and hydraulic pump motor to aid in bringing the vehicle to a safe, controlled stop in the event of severe vacuum loss at the brake booster. The ABS module continually monitors the vacuum in the brake booster through the use of a vacuum sensor. When the vacuum sensor indicates vacuum is below a predetermined level, a DTC is set in the ABS module. If this occurs during a braking event or if the driver attempts to stop the vehicle with a low vacuum condition in the brake booster, the ABS module activates the hydraulic pump motor in the HCU to assist with vehicle braking. Traction Control Function The ABS module continuously monitors and compares the rotational speed of the drive wheels in relation to the non-driven wheels. When the drive wheels begin to spin faster than the non-driven wheels, the ABS module commands the HCU to modulate brake pressure to the appropriate brake caliper. This is accomplished by opening and closing the appropriate solenoid valves inside of the HCU while the hydraulic pump motor is activated.

The ESC and RSC\u00ae functions also use input from the steering wheel rotation sensor, the stability control sensors (yaw rate, roll rate, longitudinal and lateral accelerometers) which are internal to the RCM and information from other modules sent over the HS-CAN to help maintain vehicle stability. The ABS module uses the various sensors to continuously monitor vehicle roll motion and direction of travel relative to the driver's intended course.

Steering Wheel Sensor Information For the 6.2L engine, the steering wheel rotation sensor uses an optical sensor and a slotted wheel to measure the rate of rotation (angle) of the steering wheel. The steering wheel rotation sensor uses the HSCAN to transmit information to the ABS module about steering wheel turning direction (left or right) and how far the steering wheel is being turned. The steering wheel rotation sensor does not indicate the absolute position of the steering wheel relative to straight-ahead. The ABS module learns this position by comparing the steering wheel position with other signals and storing the position it has learned. The module confirms this position and modifies it as necessary during every new driving cycle. For all other applications, the steering wheel rotation sensor is part of the EPAS system and is located inside the PSCM . The sensor is serviced with the PSCM . The PSCM uses the HS-CAN to transmit information to the ABS module about steering wheel turning direction (left or right) and how far it is being turned. The PSCM does not indicate the absolute position of the steering wheel relative to straight-ahead. The ABS module learns this position by comparing the steering wheel position with other signals and storing the position it has learned. The ABS module confirms this position and modifies it as necessary during every new driving cycle."

Normal Operation The ABS module uses the vacuum sensor to determine if hydraulic pump intervention is necessary due to a severe loss of vacuum in the booster. The ABS module sends a 5-volt reference voltage to the sensor and the sensor compares the pressure in the booster to the ambient air pressure in the engine compartment and sends a varying voltage back to the ABS module based on the difference between the pressures.

Normal Operation The ABS module uses information received from several sensors (wheel speed sensors, steering wheel rotation sensor, stability/traction control system sensors, etc.) to determine if vehicle stability, traction or roll warrants ESC or RSC\u00ae interaction. If an event is going to occur, the ABS module adjusts the brake torque at specific wheels and the PCM reduces engine torque to make the vehicle more stable. Once the ABS module has determined that the stability event has been corrected, it returns the brake and engine torque to normal and continues to monitor the vehicle. DTCs set in the ignition cycle can only be cleared by cycling the ignition off and on once the fault has been corrected. The Restraints Control Module (RCM) measures the yaw rate and vehicle acceleration, then sends the signal through a secondary, dedicated Controller Area Network (CAN) to the ABS module. The ABS module uses this information for AdvanceTrac\u00ae and RSC\u00ae system operation. The ABS module also compares this information to information it receives from other sensors (brake pedal input, steering wheel) to determine how valid the information is and to determine if an instability event is about to occur. z Ignition ON. z Verify that there is an observable symptom present. z Is an observable symptom present?

        "text": "Pinpoint Test S: Poor Vehicle Tracking During Anti-Lock Function Refer to Wiring Diagrams Cell 42 , Vehicle Dynamic Systems for schematic and connector information. Normal Operation The ABS module uses input from several different sensors (wheel speed sensors, Brake Pedal Position (BPP) switch, sensor cluster, etc.) to determine if an ABS event is necessary. If an ABS event is necessary, the ABS module commands the hydraulic pump motor on and the Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) to actuate the appropriate solenoids. During an ABS event, the front and rear end of the vehicle should track true to the direction of travel along the vehicle centerline unless driver input dictates otherwise. Other items that could cause uneven braking during an ABS event are; an internal issue with the HCU , an issue with the base brake system (caliper, brake pads, etc.) or worn out suspension components. The operating voltage required for ABS module, hydraulic pump and isolation valve operation is between 10 and 17 volts.

The trailer emulator requires the trailer tow connector ground and 12 volt trailer tow charge circuit to be connected in order to check the electric brake circuit. Battery Junction Box (BJB) fuse 21 (30A) and the Trailer Tow/Battery Charge Relay must be installed for battery voltage to be supplied to the trailer tow connector. The fuse and relay are supplied as loose-shipped items with the vehicle and may not have been installed during Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI). The Trailer Brake Control (TBC) module is an integrated electronic control device designed to provide variable braking power to the electric-actuated drum brakes on a towed trailer (1 to 4 axles only). The braking energy provided to the trailer is varied with a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal that switches between 0 volts and battery voltage, the higher the duty cycle the more braking power available. The TBC module receives information from the stoplamp switch and the PCM. The brake pressure transducer is internal to the ABS module.

The TBC module receives information through the HS-CAN . These inputs are from the PCM, the Instrument Panel Cluster (IPC) and the ABS module. The Body Control Module (BCM) also sends ignition state, park lamp status and illumination dimming level data to the TBC module. The information sent from the TBC module is passed to the IPC and is displayed on the message center. To adjust the gain setting up or down, the TBC module faceplate provides the driver with control buttons which determine the maximum power output. The TBC module faceplate also provides a manual control lever to manually apply the trailer brakes, independent of the vehicle brakes, to calibrate the gain setting to the specific trailer loading and road conditions. When the manual control lever is activated with a trailer connected to the vehicle, the trailer stoplamps and the vehicle stoplamps (except the center high mount stoplamp) illuminate. If a trailer is not connected and the manual control lever is activated, the vehicle still illuminates the vehicle stoplamps (except the center high mount stoplamp).

        "text": "Trailer Brake Control (TBC) Module Removal and Installation NOTE: The trailer brake system is normally installed at the assembly plant, however, the system can be installed at the dealership but only if the vehicle is equipped with the trailer tow option. This option can be confirmed by verifying the presence of both the 4-pin and the 7-pin connectors at the rear of the vehicle as well as a receiver hitch. If the vehicle is not equipped with these 3 items, then it is not equipped with trailer tow and cannot have the factory Trailer Brake Control (TBC) system installed. On those vehicles equipped with the trailer tow option, the electrical connector for the TBC module is attached to the 14401 harness behind the steering column opening trim panel. If the system is installed at the dealership, the TBC module will be installed in place of the coin bin/storage tray and the Instrument Panel Cluster (IPC) must be configured to communicate with the TBC module. Refer to the Wiring Diagrams manual, Cell 95 Trailer/Camper Adapter and Cell 151 Component Location Views for connector and wiring information. Refer to Programmable Parameters in the Diagnosis and Testing portion of this section for information on IPC configuration. 1. Remove the LH center instrument panel trim panel.
